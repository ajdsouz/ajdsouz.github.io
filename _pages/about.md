I am a Master's student at the Department of Language Science & Technology at Universität des Saarlandes. My interests lie in multimodality AI and mechanistic interpretability, more specifically

- How do multimodal models work?
- How do multimodal models process and learn from data?
- How can we interpret these models?

While I am not staring at my screen debugging Triton code, I like to bake, listen to music, check out new places and ride my bike (the latter two are not mutually exclusive).
